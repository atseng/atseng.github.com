		<p><b>BEFORE ITS AUGUST 18, 2012 PREMIERE</b> -in an old Jamaica Plain victorian on a street named for the famous activist Paul Robeson -before the initial attendees smashed the first plates littering in the entry doorway -before the the salvaged oak doors rusted to their core, the copper and iron pipes, the thirty four scraps of wood, the fifty pounds of dry ice, the trinkets, the foliage and the dozen small art pieces were ever transported and manifested into a vessel -before its launch as an organization combining the friendship and talents of its two co-founders for its first ever art installation showcase -there was simply just an empty space. A metaphorical space where two men met to exchange stories that they had never had the opportunity to exchange before. This is the narrative behind Art Act and its first exhibition, Salvaged Future.
			<br><br><b>5 MONTHS, 5 WEEKS, AND 5 DAYS.</b><br><br>
		<p>Starting with conversations in early 2012 -roughly 5 months before Art Act's launch- about the dynamic nature of the human condition as seen through the lens of economic woes, history, religion, science, oppression, and creativity, led ultimately to the Salvaged Future installation and the founding of a new collective of artists and activists. Salvaged Future is at its core about the embrace of loss -the oldest and most constant of human experiences. In order to create, to change, we must stand in the empty space between what we see in the world and what we hope for -that space where we confront fear, self-doubt, rejection, limitations, heartbreak, and death.</p>			
	<p>They say every object has a story. If true, the stories of the materials salvaged for Art Act's debut installation existed long before they were collected during an intensive 5-week period in mid summer 2012. Before they were ever apart of Salvaged Future, they belonged somewhere else. Their stories have imprinted them with their character -rusted, worn, peeling, and raw. Art Act sees these pieces of wood with their cracks and crevices as scars -their history traveling deep like roots. As humans we should revel in these flaws, because it is a reminder to us of the stories that we all live -the historic cycles of creation, destruction, of picking up the pieces and making something new in that gap between the world we see and the one we hope for. </p>
	<p> The result lead duo, education activist Dylan Lazerow and visual artist Allen Tseng to team up to design and manifest an experience for their friends & community. Assembled in 5 days, Salvaged Future is the manifestation of a vessel for navigating psychological space -the creation of a ship to transverse the sea in order to change old paradigms of seeing. It's about benefits of creating. Art Act attempts to share, through the experience of creation, an emerging transformative energy. Salvaged Future  is about the physical collection of salvaged materials used to communicate the narrative of loss and transition. Politically and socially, it is an experiment about the effects and changes of a work that reshapes the very thing that's shaping it. As Picasso said, "Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life." What co-founders Dylan Lazerow and Allen Tseng could never have known is how the process of creating would surface new paradigms and serendipitous emotion that then had to be addressed. What happens after? And what happens when we adapt that new paradigm of seeing not just in relation to the objects assembled? What happens when we transfer that energy toward people? The people. The friends. The communities that we surround and that surround us. The exhibit is the act of dropping of a pebble into an ocean. Even if only the faintest ripple reaches you, our manifestation of this narrative – this experience, this energy – had an effect. Art Act is about the audacity to dream – the audacity to connect – and push boundaries to stimulate growth. The essence of Art Act’s debut installation is summed up by only a few words that are so true, and so necessary for us to have a meaningful existence in this journey called life – "A ship in a harbor is safe, but that’s not what ships are built for." </p><br>
